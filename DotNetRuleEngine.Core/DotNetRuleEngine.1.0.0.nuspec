        <description>DotNetRuleEngine is a Rule Engine that allows you to write sophisticated 
rules to keep your code clean and structured. Supports both synchronous and asynchronous execution. But most importantly it does this in a very simple and elegant way. You don't need to invest so much of your precious time to learn a whole new framework.</description>
